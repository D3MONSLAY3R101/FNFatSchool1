:bf:bobeep!
:dad:Ah, right! Sorry. 
:dad:We've done it! Eheheheheeee!
:bf:Beeeeeeeep!
:bf:*The three of you let out a witchy cackle together in the graveyard.*
:dad:Ehehee! Thank you so very much, darlings! You two really are something special...
:dad:I wish every night could be like this one.
:dad:Singing spells into the night sky with friends for the first time...
:dad:Something about that fills my heart with a joy like no other! Eheheheee!
:dad:*The ghosts of the graveyard swirl around you, almost as if expecting to hear another song.
:dad:Well, would you look at that! Darlings, I think we have an audience!
:dad:Before we end the night, how about we give these ghosts and ghouls a little show?
:dad:Be warned- this time, I don't plan to hold anything back!
:bf:beboobop!
:dad:Alright then! 3, 2...!
